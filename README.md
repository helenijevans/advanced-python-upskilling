## Upskilling in Advanced Python
This markdown file serves to summarise and finalise the understanding of
the concepts I've gained in this course. Next steps after finishing this, will be completing challenges utilising
these concepts.

### Theory ðŸ“–
#### Truth Values
Python objects majorly evaluate to True.

But this is where they evaluate to False:
- If any collection is empty, e.g.: strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets
  - e.g. `if not word` can evaluate to False where `word` is a string variable.
  - > N.B This logic differs to other languages such as JS where empty collections evaluate to True
- Any number literal that equals 0
  - 0
  - 0.0
  - 0j (Complex/Imaginary Number)
  - 0/5
___
#### Predicate Functions
A function is a predicate function if it returns a Boolean value. This means a predicate function can be used to filter 
and act as a conditional function.
___
#### Anonymous Functions
A function is an anonymous function if it was declared without an identifier. Therefore an anonymous function is not usable after it is created/used.
___
#### Arguments
```python
# use keyword-only arguments to help ensure code clarity
def myFunction(arg1, arg2, *, suppressExceptions=False):
    print(arg1, arg2, suppressExceptions) 

# define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments
def addition(*args):
    return sum(args)
```
___
#### Python list comprehension vs lambda
Let us see the difference between Python list comprehension and lambda.

- List comprehension is used to create a list.
- Lambda function process is the same as other functions and returns the value of the list.
- List comprehension is more human-readable than the lambda function.
- User can easily understand where the list comprehension is used .
- List comprehension performance is better than lambda because filter() in lambda is slower than list comprehension.
___

### Best Practice ðŸ’¯
#### Docstrings
- Docstrings always in triple quotes 
- First line should be summary sentence of functionality 
- For modules, list important classes, functions, exceptions 
- For classes, list important methods 
- For functions, list parameters and explains each, one per line 
- If there's a return value, then list it; otherwise omit 
- If the function raises exceptions, mention those


```python
"""
myFunction(arg1, arg2=None) --> Doesn't really do anything special.

Parameters:
arg1: the first argument. Whatever you feel like passing.
arg2: the second argument. Defaults to None. Whatever makes you happy.
"""
```
