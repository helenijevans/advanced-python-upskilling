# Demonstrate the usage of OrderedDict objects
# Dictionary object that remembers the order in which items are inserted
# Can substitute an ordereddict anywhere where you would a normal dictionary

# Intent signaling:
# If you use OrderedDict over dict, then your code makes it clear that the order of items in the dictionary is
# important. Youâ€™re clearly communicating that your code needs or relies on the order of items in the underlying
# dictionary.

# Control over the order of items:
# If you need to rearrange or reorder the items in a dictionary,
# then you can use .move_to_end() and also the enhanced variation of .popitem().

# Equality test behaviour:
# If your code compares dictionaries for equality,
# and the order of items is important in that comparison, then OrderedDict is the right choice.
